					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab, we focused on making text messaging and chatting using the fake placeholder text, Lorem Ipsum.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I think one of the main problems for my partner and I was that things were sort of just handed to us. We just copied the code that our professor already 
                        created. I feel like it was too easy and the bonus tasks just end up being the main actual tasks that we focus on. Although I'm not complaining (because
                        this essentially takes a lot of work throughout the week off my shoulders), one thing I hope is that there would be an explanation for how a particular
                        piece of code works. For example, the coding made for creating the messages sort of had a bunch of things we did not know about such as constants and
                        what Math.floor does. I had to use ChatGPT to understand each of the steps made and overall I still didn't really understand how it worked. In any case,
                        by explaining how a code works, step-by-step, I could better learn and understand the content. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Besides that, another problem I ran into was with trying to align the button, Respond?, to the center. I conferred to ChatGPT about how I could do that and
                        they provided me with a list of methods. I tried all these methods, but for some reason the formatting would not work. It took a while, but I eventually
                        realized that I needed to provide a container for the button and set text-align there. Then, I would set the display to an inline block for the button. 
                        Although the code worked miraculously, I felt that the coding I did for it in the HTML was cluttersome and that there might've been a better way to handle
                        it.
                    </p>
