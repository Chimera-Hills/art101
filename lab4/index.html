					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this challenge, the professor had us practice pseudocoding before we jump into actual coding. Our tasks were to create an articulate outline of a routine that either one of us follow while the other was to create comments detailing the instructions for playing any simple game that could be coded. We picked "Bulls and Cows," a simple game about guessing numbers.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One of the few problems we ran into were our different backgrounds and experiences. It was a bit hard to decide on what outline to make when we both probably do things that the other doesn't. Another minor problem was on picking a game. As these sort of games are usually more local to our areas, the other partner would not know much about it. Thus, we had to take time to ourselves to clearly understand the rules to games we were not used to. Overall, after getting those things sorted, everything became much easier.</p>

							<h3>Bulls and Cows</h3>
							<p>Below is the pseudocoding for Task 2 of the game "Bulls and Cows."</p>
							<pre>

// Print out instructions
// User_one enters secret number (4 digits integer)
// User_two enters guessing number (loop until all digits are checked)
	// Check each digit:
		// If: it is one of the secret number digits and it is in the same position:
			// Add 1 point or tally to A
		// Else if: it is one of the secret number digits but at different position:
			// Add 1 point or tally to B
		// Else: Check next digit
	// Print out tallies for A and B:
		// If: digits are guessed correctly
			// Print: You win the game!
		// Else: prompt for another guess
