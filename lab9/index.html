			<h1>Lab 9 - Libraries & jQuery</h1>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this challenge, my partner and I tackled JavaScript libraries and jQuery. In particular, we worked with buttons to make it so that each section would 
						change appearance when we click it.
					</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I think one of the problems that I personally encountered was just digesting the new information I learned about libraries and jQuery. I mean, it made sense 
						that there would be libraries of pre-made JS functions that could help me but it was not exactly something I ever considered. For the most part, what this
						reminded me of were mods in games that may or may not make the game function better. Furthermore, it didn't seem like we had to do anything very
						difficult- it was just the information overload. I'm probably going to linger on this longer even after this lab is completed.
